# Ruby Stylus

`stylus` is a bridge between your Ruby code and the [Stylus](https://github.com/LearnBoost/stylus) library that runs on Node.js. It's a replacement for the [stylus_rails](https://github.com/lucasmazza/stylus_rails) gem, aiming to support the Rails 3.1 asset pipeline (via [tilt](https://github.com/rtomayko/tilt) and more agnostic cenarios, backed by the [ExecJS](https://github.com/sstephenson/execjs) gem.
